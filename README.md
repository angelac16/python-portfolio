# python-portfolio
This is where I store all my Python projects from Semester 1 and Semester 2 of my Junior Year.

Ticket Master
Key Learnings:
- This project aims to tell the audience how much their ticket will cost on the day they attend the Movie Theater.
- Despite the different movies, the prices will be the same for that specific day unless a coupon is used.
- This project taught me how to use "elif" statements repeatedly and use more complex arguments.
- Another difficulty that I worked through was setting the prices differently if one had a coupon.

Simple Calculator:
- This project aims to target people who need help in math, specifically addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- This calculator is desired to help those that struggle with math.
- During this project, I struggled to use the function, "int". However, I overcame this challenge by using the function multiple times and got the hang of it.

Nested Name:
- This project aims for people to figure out whether they have a Winter or Summer name by answering multiple questions about this or that.
- This project has allowed me to grow in areas of using two equal signs "==" and one equal sign "=". Recognizing the functions are different allowed me to know when to use which function.

Madlibs:
- This project aims to create a silly story about one who goes Trick-or-Treating.
- Before I did this project, I was uncomfortable and confused about the topic of string concatenation.
- As I was completing this project, I got comfortable with doing string concatenation. This silly story will never be unforgettable because I had a fun time inputting silly nouns, colors, verbs, etc.

Multiplication Quiz:
- This project aims to test kindergarteners on their multiplication skills.
- This project reminded me how to use the function "random.randint" and taught me how the function of "str" is to make a number become a string and "int" is to make a string into a number.
- A difficulty I worked through was incrementing the question number each time the student took this quiz. 

Slot Machine:
- This project shows how much luck and possibility of a chance a user would get a thunder, heart, 7, and a 3 in the slot machine.
- This project shows that being lucky and getting all 7's or all 3's is very lucky as it is a low chance.

Magic Eight Ball:
- This project is for those users who have been thinking about disturbing or concerned topics in their mind. They believe in things that are meant to be, hope, and toys that tell fortune.
- This project allows users to recieve the answer to their question without anyone knowing the question so it is private.
