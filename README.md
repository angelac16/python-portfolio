# python-portfolio
This is where I store all my Python projects from Semester 1 of my Junior Year.

Ticket Master
Key Learnings:
- This project aims to tell the audience how much their ticket will cost on the day they attend the Movie Theater.
- Despite the different movies, the prices will be the same for that specific day unless a coupon is used.
- This project taught me how to use "elif" statements repeatedly and use more complex arguments.
- Another difficulty that I worked through was setting the prices differently if one had a coupon.

Simple Calculator:
- This project aims to target people who need help in math, specifically addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- This calculator is desired to help those that struggle with math.
- During this project, I struggled to use the function, "int". However, I overcame this challenge by using the function multiple times and got the hang of it.

Nested Name:
- This project aims for people to figure out whether they have a Winter or Summer name by answering multiple questions about this or that.
- This project has allowed me to grow in areas of using two equal signs "==" and one equal sign "=". Recognizing the functions are different allowed me to know when to use which function.

Madlibs:
- This project aims to create a silly story about one who goes Trick-or-Treating.
- Before I did this project, I was uncomfortable and confused about the topic of string concatenation.
- As I was completing this project, I got comfortable with doing string concatenation. This silly story will never be unforgettable because I had a fun time inputting silly nouns, colors, verbs, etc.

Multiplication Quiz:
- This project aims to test kindergarteners on their multiplication skills.
- This project reminded me how to use the function "random.randint" and taught me how the function of "str" is to make a number become a string and "int" is to make a string into a number.
- A difficulty I worked through was incrementing the question number each time the student took this quiz.
